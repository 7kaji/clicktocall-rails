## Welcome to the Twilio Click-to-call example for Rails

Click-to-call converts your website's users into engaged customers by creating an easy way for your customers to contact your sales and support teams right on your website.  Using a simple form on your web page, your users can input a phone number and receive a phone call connecting to any destination phone number you like - the sales representative for that territory, your support call center or an after hours voicemail.

Online retailers report click-to-call forms produce better conversion rates, higher average orders and increased sales.  We can build one together right now in the language of your choice.  Support organizations report click-to-call forms reduce friction in resolving issues, increasing customer satisfaction and lowering response times.

To get up and running be sure to add your Twilio key and auth token to your ENV. Then run `bundle install && rails server`
